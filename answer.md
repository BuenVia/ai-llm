The provided line of code uses a Python feature called a generator expression in combination with the `yield from` statement to yield values from a set. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Set Comprehension**: 
   - The expression `{book.get("author") for book in books if book.get("author")}` is a set comprehension that creates a set of authors from a collection of `books`.
   - `book.get("author")`: This attempts to retrieve the value associated with the key `"author"` from the `book` dictionary. 
   - `for book in books`: This iterates through each `book` in the `books` iterable (presumably a list of dictionaries).
   - `if book.get("author")`: This condition checks if the author exists (i.e., is not `None` or an empty string) before including it in the set. 

2. **Yield from**:
   - `yield from` is a way to yield all values from an iterable. In this context, it means that the set created by the comprehension will be yielded one by one.
   - This allows the surrounding generator function to produce each unique author without manually iterating through the resulting set.

### Summary of What the Code Does:
- The code extracts authors from a list of book dictionaries called `books`, ensuring that only non-empty/valid author names are included. The unique authors are then yielded individually by the generator function.

### Why Use This Code?
- **Uniqueness**: By using a set, the code automatically filters out duplicate authors since sets do not allow duplicate entries.
- **Efficiency**: Using `yield from` allows values to be generated on-the-fly (lazily), which can be more memory-efficient than creating a complete list or just returning all unique authors at once.
- **Readability**: The use of set comprehension and `yield from` makes the code concise and expressive, clearly conveying its intent.
